                    related to potential or existing cyber threats. This information is used to understand the tactics,
                    techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber adversaries, and to identify indicators of compromise
                    (IOCs). The goal of CTI is to provide actionable insights that help organizations anticipate,
                    prevent, and respond to cyber threats, thereby enhancing their overall security posture. CTI
                    encompasses strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence to support decision-making at various
                    levels within an organization.

                    <strong>Firewall</strong> <br>
                    A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing
                    network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary purpose is to create a barrier
                    between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

                    An endpoint is any device that connects to a network and communicates with other devices or systems.
                    Endpoints can include a wide range of devices such as: <br>

                    <strong>Incident Response</strong> <br>
                    An Incident Response Plan (IRP) is a systematic approach designed to manage and mitigate the effects
                    of cybersecurity incidents, such as data breaches, malware infections, or other security threats.
                    The primary goal of an IRP is to handle incidents in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery
                    time and costs.

                    <strong>Vulnerability Assessment</strong> <br>
                    A vulnerability assessment is a systematic process used to identify, evaluate, and prioritize
                    security weaknesses in an organization's IT infrastructure, applications, and processes. The goal is
                    to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats and to recommend appropriate measures
                    to mitigate the risks.

                    <strong>Penetration Test</strong> <br>
                    A penetration test, often referred to as a "pen test," is a simulated cyber attack against an
                    organization's IT infrastructure to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. The goal of a penetration
                    test is to evaluate the security of the system by attempting to breach its defenses, thereby
                    providing a real-world assessment of its resilience to cyber threats
