                        <strong>What are Security Operations (SecOps)?</strong> <br>
                        Security Operations or SecOps is a term used to describe the collaboration between security and
                        operations teams within an organization. IT operations has continued to expand over the years,
                        branching out into individual specialties that tends to create siloed activities. SecOps seeks
                        to foster more collaboration between IT security and IT operations to help prioritize network
                        and data security and mitigate risk without sacrificing IT performance. It also provides a more
                        narrow focus than the similar concept of DevSecOps, as DevOps teams are not a requirement for
                        creating and implementing an organization's security measures. A key tenet of SecOps, however,
                        is to ensure that security is a fundamental part of every project and included in even the
                        earliest stages of project development.<a style="font-size: 12px;"

                        <strong>What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?</strong> <br>
                        Security Operations Center or SOC is a team of experts that proactively monitor an
                        organization's ability to operate secuerly. A SOC Team gathers information from various
                        resources, including <a href="../../cybergloss/cybergloss.html#cti">Cyber Threat Intelligence
                            (CTI)</a> feeds to the log files from systems all around the enterprise. A SOC team
                        carefully
                        monitors a company's assets, from on-premise servers in data centers to cloud resources.
                        Accurate monitoring is critical. Therefore, SOC team members will monitor servers, end points
                        and perimeter devices like firewalls and switches.

                        <strong>What a Security Operations Center (SOC) does?</strong><br>
                        SOC activites and responsibilites falls into 3 general categories <br><br>
                    <div class="tab">

                            Prevention</button>

                            compliance</button>
                    </div>

                    <div id="Tab1" class="tabcontent">
                        <strong>Asset Inventory:</strong> A SOC needs to maintain an exhaustive inventory of everything
                        that needs to be protected, inside or outside the data center (for example applications,
                        databases, servers, cloud services, endpoints, etc.) and all the tools used to protect them
                        (firewalls, antivirus/anti-malware/anti-ransomware tools, monitoring software, etc.). Many SOCs
                        will use an asset discovery solution for this task. <br><br>
                        <strong>Routine maintenance and preparation: </strong>To maximize the effectiveness of security
                        tools and measures in place, the SOC performs preventive maintenance such as applying software
                        patches and upgrades, and continually updating firewalls, allowlist and blocklists, and security
                        policies and procedures. The SOC can also create system backups—or assist in creating backup
                        policies or procedures—to ensure business continuity in the event of a data breach, ransomware
                        attack or other cybersecurity incident. <br><br>
                        <strong>Incident response planning: </strong>The SOC is responsible for developing the
                        organization's incident response plan, which defines activities, roles and responsibilities in
                        the event of a threat or incident, and the metrics by which the success of any incident response
                        will be measured. <br><br>
                        <strong>Regular Testing: </strong>The SOC team performs vulnerability assessments—comprehensive
                        assessments that identify each resource's vulnerability to potential or emerging threats and the
                        associate costs. It also conducts penetration tests that simulate specific attacks on one or
                        more systems. The team remediates or fine-tunes applications, security policies, best practices
                        and incident response plans based on the results of these tests. <br><br>
                        <strong>Staying current: </strong>The SOC stays up to date on the latest security solutions and
                        technologies, and on the latest threat intelligence—news and information about cyberattacks and
                        the hackers who perpetrate them, gathered from social media, industry sources and the dark web.
                    </div>

                    <div class="tabcontent" id="Tab2">
                        <strong>Continuous, around-the-clock security monitoring: </strong> The SOC monitors the entire
                        extended IT infrastructure—applications, servers, system software, computing devices, cloud
                        workloads, the network—24/7/365 for signs of known exploits and for any suspicious activity.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Log Management: </strong> Log management—the collection and analysis of log data
                        generated by every network event—is an important subset of monitoring. While most IT departments
                        collect log data, it's the analysis that establishes normal or baseline activity and reveals
                        anomalies that indicate suspicious activity. In fact, many hackers count on the fact that
                        companies don't always analyze log data, which can allow their viruses and malware to run
                        undetected for weeks or even months on the victim's systems. Most SIEM solutions include log
                        management capability. <br><br>
                        <strong>Threat Detection: </strong> The SOC team sorts the signals from the noise—the
                        indications of actual cyberthreats and hacker uses from the false positives—and then triages the
                        threats by severity. Modern SIEM solutions include artificial intelligence (AI) that automates
                        these processes and which 'learns' from the data to get better at spotting suspicious activity
                        over time. <br><br>
                        <strong>Incident Response: </strong> In response to a threat or actual incident, the SOC moves
                        to limit the damage. Actions can include:

                        - Root cause investigation, to determine the technical vulnerabilities that gave hackers access
                        to
                        the system, as well as other factors (such as bad password hygiene or poor enforcement of
                        policies) that contributed to the incident. <br>
                        - Shutting down compromised endpoints or disconnecting them from the network. <br>
                        - Isolating compromised areas of the network or rerouting network traffic. <br>
                        - Pausing or stopping compromised applications or processes. <br>
                        - Deleting damaged or infected files. <br>
                        - Running antivirus or anti-malware software. <br>
                        - Decommissioning passwords for internal and external users. <br>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tabcontent" id="Tab3">
                        <strong>Recovery and Remediation: </strong>Once an incident is contained, the SOC eradicates
                        the threat, then works to recover the impacted assets to their state before the incident (for
                        example wiping, restoring and reconnecting disks, user devices and other endpoints; restoring
                        network traffic; restarting applications and processes). In the event of a data breach or
                        ransomware attack, recovery might also involve cutting over to backup systems, and resetting
                        passwords and authentication credentials. <br><br>
                        <strong>Post-mortem and refinement: </strong>To prevent a recurrence, the SOC uses any new
                        intelligence gained from the incident to better address vulnerabilities, update processes and
                        policies, choose new cybersecurity tools or revise the incident response plan. At a higher
                        level, SOC team might also try to determine whether the incident reveals a new or changing
                        cybersecurity trend for which the team needs to prepare. <br><br>
                        <strong>Compliance management: </strong>It's the SOC's job to ensure all applications, systems
                        and security tools and processes comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR (Global Data
                        Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry
                        Data Security Standard), and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).
                        Following an incident, the SOC makes sure that users, regulators, law enforcement and other
                        parties are notified in accordance with regulations and that the required incident data is
                        retained for evidence and auditing.

                    A Security Operations Center (SOC) typically operates with a tiered structure to efficiently manage
                    and respond to security incidents. Each tier has specific roles and responsibilities, with
                    increasing levels of expertise and complexity.

                    <!-- ================= BENEFITS OF SOC ================= -->
                    <strong>Security Operations Center (SOC) benefits:</strong> <br>
                    <strong>- Asset Protection: </strong>The proactive monitoring and rapid response capabilities of SOCs
                    help prevent unauthorized access and minimize the risk of data breaches. This will safeguard
                    critical systems, sensitive data and intellectual property from security breaches and theft.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>- Business continuity: </strong>By reducing security incidents and minimizing their impact,
                    SOCs ensure uninterrupted business operations. This helps maintain productivity, revenue streams and
                    customer satisfaction. <br><br>

                    <strong>- Regulatory Compliance: </strong>SOCs help organizations meet regulatory requirements and
                    industry standards for cybersecurity by implementing effective security measures and maintaining
                    detailed records of incidents and responses. <br><br>

                    <strong>- Cost savings: </strong>Investing in proactive security measures through a SOC can result in
                    significant savings by preventing costly data breaches and cyberattacks. The upfront investment is
                    often far less than the financial damages and risks to reputation caused by a security incident,
                    and, if outsourced, replaces the need for staffing security professionals in-house. <br><br>

                    <strong>- Customer Trust: </strong>Demonstrating a commitment to cybersecurity through the operation
                    of a SOC enhances trust and confidence among customers and stakeholders. <br><br>

                    <strong>- Enchanced incident response: </strong>The rapid response capabilities of SOCs reduce
                    downtime and financial losses by containing threats and quickly restoring normal operations to
                    minimize disruptions. <br><br>

                    <strong>- Improved risk management: </strong>By analyzing security events and trends, SOC teams can
                    identify an organization's potential vulnerabilities. They can then take proactive measures to
                    mitigate them before they are exploited. <br><br>

                    <strong>- Proactive threat detection: </strong>By continuously monitoring networks and systems, SOCs
                    can more quickly identify and mitigate security threats. This minimizes potential damage and data
                    breaches and helps organizations stay ahead of an evolving threat landscape. <br><br>
